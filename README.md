# Computer-Vision-Project-RPS
The goal of this project is to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in python, which will be processed in a live video and it will be able to give instant results to the users. The first step in this project is to teach the computer what images and signs to recognise, and then creating a program, which uses the camera to capture and recognise images/signs of Rock, Paper or Scissor when displayed by the players. Then print the result of the winner. Some difficulties that might occur are the variety of lighting conditions, the different backgrounds, the hand gesture identification and more
